This article encourages developers to structure sites as a user focused "path based" site, rather than the traditional "hierarchical" organization.

It seems like many websites figure this out much later, but rather than revamping their navigation, they add a new sidebar full of popular links. "X is our most popular page, but to get there, people click on 5 links. Put a link on the home page" - rinse and repeat to infinity and you've got a [page full of links to other pages](http://store.apple.com/).
