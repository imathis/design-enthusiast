![Adobe ruins usability with a hideous scrollbar](/content/blog/2008/adobe_scrolls.png "hideous")

I'm amazed that Adobe can be so backward. Taking over the web browser's interface is offensive especially when it breaks the usability.

Note: not only did they change the look of my sidebar, they also broke scrolling with my mouse. This is unacceptable, especially from a company that creates design tools.
