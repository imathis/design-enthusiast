title: A Redesign Rumble - "The Dawn of Bliss"
category: design
---

**Of everything I've learned in the past three years, what I've been working on in the last two months is the most exciting.** I'm talking about [Compass](http://compass-style.org), which I'd describe as "the dawn of a bliss" for web designers.

At the beginning of the week, I tweeted:

> 5 hour rumble with [@pilgrimgeorge](http://twitter.com/pilgrimgeorge) on a redesign of [http://christiangeorge.org](http://christiangeorge.org) No mockups, straight to HTML/CSS. Compass is my ally. Pumped!

Using Compass (which leverages the power of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)), I was able to infuse my stylesheets with the power of 'mixins' allowing me to be extremely agile during the design process. This enabled me to skip the mockup phase, and go straight to the code.

**After five hours we had a freshly conceived design**, and time left over to do photography, manage some content, and discuss a roadmap for the future direction of the site. The design process was so smooth I'm working to release it as an open source <del>Wordpress</del> **Jekyll** template, hopefully in the next month or so.

*This is the first in a series of posts where I'll share how Compass is improving my design process. I'll be writing about specific areas where Compass makes my life easier, including source code and links to [github](http://github.com/imathis) where I'll be sharing many of my mixins.*
