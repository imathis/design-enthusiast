While working on [memberhub.com](http://memberhub.com), creating custom avatars wasn't in the budget, so I designed them anyway and released them for free. The latest
version has transparent PNGs that allow use background colors or images for simple customization.

Site note: I've also added a [projects page](/projects/) where I'll be adding my open source projects. This will make linking easier, and prevent
my projects from getting lost under blog posts.
