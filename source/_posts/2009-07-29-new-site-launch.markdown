title: New Site Launch
category: site
---

I&rsquo;m finally replacing my old wordpress blog with a [jekyll](http://github.com/henrick/jekyll/) powered site. I built this site to host my professional work as a web designer, share my open source projects, and give me a space to write about things that inspire me.

I&rsquo;m also hosting the source code for generating this site on [github](http://github.com/imathis/design-enthusiast/)
so if you&rsquo;re curious, you&rsquo;re welcome to have a look under the hood. Although I do reserve rights to the content, you&rsquo;re welcome to use any code for your own site, if you like.
