<img src="/projects/fancy-avatars/fancy-avatars.png" alt="avatar" title=""/> I'm sick of lame default avatars so I designed some [Fancy Avatars](/projects/fancy-avatars/).

I've also added a [projects page](/projects/) where I'll be adding my open source projects. This will make linking easier, and prevent
my projects from getting lost under blog posts.
