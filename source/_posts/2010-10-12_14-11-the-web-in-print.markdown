A couple of days ago I posted a [screencast](/blog/2010/10/08/how-to-get-high-resolution-screenshots-of-a-website) on producing high resolution screenshots of a website for print.
If I'm honest, when I made that screencast, I had really just discovered the method for getting hi-res screenshots. I was sure it would work, but I hadn't actually tried using them in the design.

Now, I've actually completed the design and I wanted to share the finished work.

One thing to note. If you're working in Illustrator, save the screenshots as a separate document and use the "place" command to link the screenshot PDF instead of copying it over into the primary design file.
This is way faster since Illustrator doesn't have to keep track of all the points and controls it just has to render the PDF.
