Interesting to see [the R&D budgets](http://techblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/04/why-doesnt-microsoft-outinnova.html) of these big companies. Microsoft spent $7.4 billion last year on research and development. We already have our [stupid table](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZrr7AZ9nCY) what else could we need?

Perhaps they're starting and abandoning some wonderful projects, or at least playing catch up with OS X Leopard and the iPhone.
