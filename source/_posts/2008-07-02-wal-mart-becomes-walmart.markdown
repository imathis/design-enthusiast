It would seem that Walmart has lost another round of "she loves me not"

Check out their [previous logos](http://walmartstores.com/AboutUs/8412.aspx) for reference

I feel like either Walmart has more vitamin C, or they are offering some kind of web hosting solution. It's almost as if they used some [Web 2.0 Logo Generator](http://creatr.cc/creatr/ "Web 2.0 Logo Generator") but forgot the glare and reflections.

I like the customizations they've done to make the font more unique. Well, all except for the 'W', which to me looks like it should be at the beginning of the word "Waterpark." They did well to remove the hyphen and choose title case rather than all caps. It no longer feels like their logo shouting at us, but in the friendliness department, they went too far.

The weight of the logo is so obviously wrong. It's totally offset by some kind of oversized popsicle seance. I can't even read the tag line, because as soon as I get to the second 'a' in Walmart, I get distracted by a freaking fireworks show.

This makes me mad. Seriously. Because I know that I will see it all over the place. It will follow me around, taunting me with it's mediocre lameness. Also I will inevitably have a craving for baby carrots.
