## What is Octopress?

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.

3. **Third party integration is simple** with built-in support for Twitter, Pinboard, Delicious, Disqus Comments, and Google Analytics.
4. **It's easy to use.** A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
