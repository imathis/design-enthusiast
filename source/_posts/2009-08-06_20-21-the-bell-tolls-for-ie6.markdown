[The "Death to IE6" campaign gathers more steam](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136286/_Kill_IE6_campaign_gains_force_30M_Web_users_get_switch_pitch).

Web developers have been trying to encourage the masses [to](http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/) [stop](http://browsehappy.com/) [using](http://www.killbillsbrowser.com/) [IE6](http://www.end6.org/) for quite some time.
Some webmasters are so desperate they are borrowing from the malware author's playbook and trying to [trick IE6 users into upgrading](http://ie6update.com/)

Lately some major players have decided to join the effort ([Youtube](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/youtube-will-be-next-to-kiss-ie6-support-goodbye/) and [Digg](http://blog.digg.com/?p=878) among others) and it seems that we might finally be getting somewhere.

Note: This site has not been tested in IE6. If it looks like rubbish I don't care.
