title: "Coping With Your Family?"
---

While you work at a MegaCorp "developing strategy", you long for a product that would keep you focused, and get you through the day.
Sometimes you even dream of a device that could help you **cope with your family**.

RIM understands your disconnected needs. Introducing the BlackBerry Playbook.

Message matters. I cannot relate to the person being described here. This is a perspective &mdash; beyond marketing &mdash; that defines the role of technology in our lives. Unless RIM makes some bold changes they'll never escape the corporate niche.

Watch the [Playbook ad](http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rbN9m3ywJ0), and compare that to [Apple's iPad commercial](http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BvVcSkNkA).
By contrast, Playbook looks impersonal &mdash; even fictional. I mean, you barely see anyone holding it, or using it in a real setting. Some are even suggesting that [it doesn't exist](http://www.singularityhacker.com/2010/09/blackberry-playbook-doesnt-exist.html).

I have far greater hopes that an Android tablet will someday compete with the iPad. Come to think of it, what ever happened to Chrome OS?
