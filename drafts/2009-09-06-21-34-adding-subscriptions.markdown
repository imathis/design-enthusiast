I'm slowly releasing improvements to this site, as I have time to work on them. Today I'm adding subscriptions.
When considering RSS vs. Atom, I came across [this artice](http://blogs.iis.net/vsood/archive/2008/10/06/the-world-of-syndication-atom-1-0-vs-rss-2-0.aspx)
which has a handy feature chart. I chose Atom.
