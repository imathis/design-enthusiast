title: High Quality Ampersands on the Web

Want fancy ampersands on the web? You're best bet is to use an italic serif font, but what fonts are safe? Until we have @font-face, [these are the options](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/08/14/ampersands.html).

Baskerville is my favorite on this page, but for a font that will be common on windows I'd choose Palatino Linotype as a backup.
