title: A Redesign Rumble <span class="amp">&amp;</span> "The Dawn of Bliss"
category: design

**Of everything I've learned in the past three years, what I've been working on in the last two months is the most exciting.** I'm talking about [Compass](http://compass-style.org), which I'd describe as "the dawn of a bliss" for web designers.

A couple of weeks ago I tweeted

> 5 hour rumble with [@pilgrimgeorge](http://twitter.com/pilgrimgeorge) on a redesign of [http://christiangeorge.org](http://christiangeorge.org) No mockups, straight to HTML/CSS. Compass is my ally. Pumped!

Using Compass (which leverages the power of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)), I was able to infuse my stylesheets with the power of 'mixins' allowing me to be extremely agile during the design process. This enabled me to skip the mockup phase, and go straight to the code.

**Here's an example.** The typographic units on Christian's new site &mdash; things like font-sizes, line-height, and heading margins &mdash; are all being generated from a single base font size. Math is one of the primary components of typography, and using Compass, I was able to express typographic design principles in an abstract way. As a result we were able to test different several typography settings simply by changing the base font size.

About three years ago, Christian and I got together and designed the first iteration of his site in one sitting. He fed me content and feedback and I cranked out the php, html, and css, and we launched his [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) blog in just under ten hours. It was crazy fun. When he came to me with ideas for a redesign I couldn't wait to test Compass in a rapid design rumble.

**After five hours we had a freshly conceived design**, and time left over to do photography, manage some content, and discuss a roadmap for the future direction of the site. The design process was so smooth I'm working to release it as an open source Wordpress template, hopefully in the next month or so.

*This is the first in a series of posts where I'll share how Compass is improving my design process. I'll be writing about specific areas where Compass makes my life easier, including source code and links to [github](http://github.com/imathis) where I'll be sharing many of my mixins.*
