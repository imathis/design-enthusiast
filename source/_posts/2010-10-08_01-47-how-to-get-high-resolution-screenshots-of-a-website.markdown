title: "How To Get High Resolution Screenshots Of A Website"
tags: Screencast, video
---

I'm working on a brochure for [cofamilies.com](http://cofamilies.com) (a web app I'm designing) and we want to highlight some screenshots from the app. Problem is,
taking a screenshot doesn't give you print quality resolution images. So how do you get a high resolution image from a web app? I found a cool way to solve this problem and so I decided to put together a screencast
to show you what I came up with.

<video width="640" height="360" preload="none" controls poster="http://s3.imathis.com/video/site-to-print.png">
  <source src="http://s3.imathis.com/video/site-to-print.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"' />
</video>

**Just so you know**, in the video the gradients appear to be a little blocky, they are actually quite smooth and that's just a result of the video compression. Here's an uncompressed screenshot to prove it.

If you have a better way of doing this, I'd love to hear about it. Also, If you find this helpful let me know.
