'Tis the season to rebrand yourself, and in that spirit, I've put together this post to help you with your logo redesign.
I'll be drawing on lessons learned from the branding masters at Gap and MySpace to show you how to design a logo people will hate so much they'll be forced to tweet and tumbl in their fits of rage.

### Gap's logo lessons

**1. Don't waste time or money on fonts.** <br/>
Simply use any font that came with your computer. Have you seen how much fonts cost?

**2. Add a geometric shape.** <br/>
This way it doesn't just look like some word typed on a screen. Now it's a logo!

### MySpace's logo lessons

**1. Be clever.** <br/>
Make it confusing at first. Your logo should be like a fun puzzle with an "Oh, I get it" at the end.

**2. Always use your first idea.** <br/>
Be careful, clever logos can take a lot of work. For example, everyone knows by now that FedEx has hidden an arrow and a spoon in their logo. That probably took a long time, and it's too easy read. Avoid that.

### My new logo

I took the ideas above and redesigned my own logo. Please go crazy with hatred and tell the world what a fool I am.
