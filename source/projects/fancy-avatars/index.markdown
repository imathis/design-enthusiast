While working on [memberhub.com](http://memberhub.com), creating custom avatars wasn't in the budget, so I designed them anyway and released them for free. The latest
version has transparent PNGs that allow use background colors or images for simple customization.

##### Why Bother?
<img src="no_avatar.png" alt="lame avatar" title="Lame Avatar"/> Why spend all this time designing what's essentially
a placeholder that users are going to cover up anyway? If the app you just joined says you look like a chubby pawn,
that poor experience, even if it's temporary. If your app does this, think about how unwelcoming that is.
It should be nice to be a new user, and giving users a nice identity shows them you care.
