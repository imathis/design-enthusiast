Here's a quick screencast demonstrating how you can use [fancy buttons](http://github.com/imathis/fancy-buttons) to easily generate beautiful flexible CSS3 buttons.

Here's a [live demo](/projects/fancy-buttons/demo/) and here's the [project page](/projects/fancy-buttons/)

**Update:** For those who've asked, the color picker I'm using in this screen cast is from [xScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope), an excellent set of tools by the Iconfactory. It has:

1. A dimension measurement tool. [See it in action](http://iconfactory.com/graphics/software/xscope/xScope.mov).
2. Screen rulers
3. Screen resolution frames
4. The color picker (Loupe)
5. Guides
6. Frames (adjustable floating marker boxes)
7. Crosshairs (for easy alignment)

This is one of my favorite apps out there. I use these tools all the time and they're great for in browser designers.
